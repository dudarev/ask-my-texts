    "answer": "The rabbits hid themselves and the onions underneath a large basket when they saw the cat. Old Mr. Benjamin Bunny cuffed the cat off the basket and kicked it into the green-house, then locked the door. He then took out his son Benjamin by the ears, whipped him with the little switch, took out his nephew Peter, and marched out of the garden. It is not mentioned what happened to the rabbits after that. Mr. McGregor observed foot-marks that were too small to be human and could not understand how the cat managed to lock herself up inside the green-house. Peter and his family folded up the pocket-handkerchief, strung up the onions, and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit-tobacco. \n",
